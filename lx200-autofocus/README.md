## Autofocuser Rig for LX200 ACF OTA

This is completely inspired by jamesdedij's design for the C8 (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4191869)

I then started from TrevOinAus's design for the LX90 (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4592948) which needed to be adjusted to work with the LX200 knob and the back that I needed a holder for a NEMA14 motor not an EAF.
