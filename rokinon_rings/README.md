# Rings for Rokinon Cine DS 135mm

Created from RomanHujer's wonderful project for the similar Samyang 135mm lens (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4667525 and https://github.com/romanhujer/Samyang-135-for-Astronomy)

I only utilized his logic for the front and rear rings and the gear to integrate with the focuser. I've modified the front ring to allow a longer dovetail to run between the two rings which lets me have a pretty solid foundation for a guide scope (see the [finder_holder](../finder_holder) project that goes with this design)
